👋🏽 I’m Tomas Szemzo, and this is a short intro to me. I hope you’ll find it useful if we need to work together.

## ⚙️ How I work

- Let's have good communication: don't misunderstand me, we don't need to sync 1000 times a day, but if we are in the same team, let's track what needs to be done and making sure we're all on the same page.
- "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones": I like to keep changes small, easy to undo and explain.
- Keep it simple: I like my code to be very clear, understandable and easy to explain.
- If any flow, process or code part is particularly complex, let's document it properly as tomorrow maybe someone needs to take a look on that.
- Let's keep an eye on our codebase, trying to keep readability and code quality as high as possible.
- Review, review, review... In my experience, code reviews are one of the places (if not the most) where I've learnt more, I consider it a must practice. Obviously always with respect and sense of responsibility.
